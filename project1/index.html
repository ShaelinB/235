                    <p id = "text-col2-1">Johnny Rocket was developed in MonoGame using C#. During the course of this project, I was in charge of implementing and creating UI and a debug mode for testing. I achieved this by creating a button class that instantiated the buttons and had a method to check if the button was clicked once. For the debug mode whenever you hit F1 all enemies and the player were highlighted a certain color and projected their stats onto the screen. I also </p>
                    <p id = "text-col3-1">implementing all the code in the game loop. I did this by organizing what pieces of code had to go where. This ensured the overall logic was correct and the game objects were shown in the correct z position. Besides from that, a colleague and I collaborated on a file management system that was used to efficiently load levels. We did this by using multiple text files so we could tell what the map was and what was an enemy or player.</p>

                    <p id = "text-col2-2">Monochromatic was developed in Unity using C#. For the project I created and implemented 2D assets using software like Adobe Photoshop, Krita, Shotcut, and Audacity. The assets I made include the player and enemies, the scenery, UI design, and the opening cut scene. For the player animations, I had to enhance the premade FSM in order to get smoother transitions into the individual animations. I did this by changing up some of the preexisting scripts and </p>
                    <p id = "text-col3-2">adding more states and conditions to the FSM. For the UI design I made multiple assets for buttons and attached scripts to them to change scenes whenever one was clicked. While making the open cut scene I mainly used Krita to create each frame then exported that as a MP4. Then, I used Audacity to make the soundtrack and Shotcut to implement the soundtrack and edit the MP4 to include transitions. </p>
