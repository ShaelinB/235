    Process of gathering information:<br>
    1. The user enters a pokemon and the generation they're in and selects what type of info they want to recieve <br>
    2. Once the user hits select it makes a link using the generation. <br>
    3. That link is used to check if that pokemon is in that generation. If it isn't it displays an error, otherwise it retrieves the link for the species <br>
    <br>
    If you chose stats: <br>
    4. Once you check if that pokemon exists it creates a new link specific to the pokemon <br>
    5. This link contains the data for it's type, base stats, and image. <br>
    6. Displays data <br>
    <br>    
    If you chose evolution:<br>
    4. Using that link you can get to the evolution chain for that species. <br>
    5. Displays data using a recursive method to go through the whole evolution tree. <br>
</p>

<p>
    3 UI Controls: <br>
    search bar <br>
    generation dropdown <br>
    information dropdown <br>
</p>

<p>
    Additional Notes: <br>
    1. The status changes to searching for pokemonName once the button is clicked but the data is retrieved really fast so you can't see it<br>
    2. CSS uses flexbox<br>
    3. The website is responsive<br>
</p>

<p>
    Reflection: <br>
    API: 10 - looks up the stats, evolution, and image of the pokemon <br>
    Local Storage: 10 - saves the generation and pokemon name <br>
    Controls: 10 - search bar, generation drop down, and information drop down <br>
    Error-Free: 10 - works as intended with no errors <br>
    Code: 10 - javascript and css is stored externally, it's commented, uses let, const, and query selector<br>
    Semantic structure: 4 - uses meaningful elements to organize content such as divs with different ids<br>
    Valid-HTML: 3 - doesn't like how the img has an empty src but it's supposed to be like that in the beginning so the javascript can fill it in with the correct url of the pokemon image<br>
    Valid-CSS: 4 - when run through the validator it doesn't list any errors<br>
    Visual Design: 8 - simple design but looks good and doesn't look like the GIF finder <br>
    Interaction Design: 6 - the error may be a bit broad, but other than that everything else works <br>
    Responsive Design: 8 - the app is fully responsive, uses flexbox, and looks good on a phone<br>
    Checkpoints Deliverables: 8 - the proposal and initial build were on time <br>
    Documentation: 6 - shown above<br>
