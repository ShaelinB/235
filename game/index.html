        <main><h1>Description</h1>

            <p><em>Dig Dug</em> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you <strong>have</strong> to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. 
                Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will <strong>continually</strong> chase you around.
                The <strong>only</strong> weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]<br>
