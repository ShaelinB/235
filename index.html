        <p> 
            At my time here at RIT I have been majoring in game design and development. 
            It has been difficult at times though it is enjoyable. I am currently taking 
            IGME 235 and a goal that I have is I want to finish this class with the knowledge 
            on how to make good looking websites. After I graduate college I hope to be employeed 
            in a game company and eventually make my own successful video game. Some of my 
            current intrests are volleyball, pickleball, ice skating, video games, and reading.
